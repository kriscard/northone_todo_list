## Description

For the Northone Challenge TodoList, I used the elements belows:
```
  - Create-react-app with Typescript template
  - React hooks
  - React contexts for the state of the Todo (all the todo are stored inside the localstorage)
  - Styled components for CSS
  - Eslint adapted for TypeScript
  - Deployed on Netlify
  - Jest test

For the record, the CSS wasn't my main focus
 ```

## How to run the app in local

```
yarn install
yarn start
