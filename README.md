For the Northone Challenge TodoList I used the elements belows:
  - Create-react-app with Typescript template
  - React hooks
  - React contexts for the state of the Todo (all the todo are stored inside the localstorage)
  - Styled components for CSS
  - Eslint adapted for TypeScript
  - Deployed on Netlify

**#TODO:** 
The folowed list are all the elements I wish to do if I get more time:
  - Add some tests
  - Fix some type issues (I still have 3 `any`) 
  - Create a global interface to regroup all the types and share it throught the app (that allows to not have interface on each files)
  - Add more features like: Give the possibility to attach a file ...
  - Fix an issue with the Edit part. I cannot edit the first todo but only the rest (the 2nd, 3rd ....)
