Northone Challange TodoList using the followed elements:
  - Created react app with Typescript template
  - React hooks
  - React contexts for the state for the Todo (all the todo are stored inside the localstorage)
  - Styled components for CSS
  - Eslint adapted for TypeScript
  - Deployed on Netlify

**#TODO:** 
The folowed list are all the elements I wish to do if I get more time:
  - Add some test
  - Fix some type issues (I still have 3 any) 
  - Create a global interface that regroup all the types and share it througt the app (that allows to not have interface on each files)
  - Add more features like: Give the possibility to attached a files
  - Fix an issue with the Edit part. I cannot edit the first todo but only the rest (the 2nd, 3rd ....)
